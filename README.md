## What this is about

A very minimal implementation of the ResNet architecture.

There are many like it on the internet, but this one is MINE.

What has been done 

- ResNet-18/34/50/101/152 implemented
- built training pipeline
- built validation pipeline (saves confusion matrix into val_results folder)

## How to run 

To use 18 and 34 variants, utilise the `resnet_34_below.py`. To use the 50/101/152 variants, call in the `resnet_50_above.py`
