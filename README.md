## What this is about

A very minimal implementation of the ResNet architecture.

There are many like it on the internet, but this one is MINE.

What has been done 

- ResNet-34 implemented

What needs to be done

- ResNet-50, 102 etc
- The above requires retooling the identity block (it currently only caters to ResNet-34)
